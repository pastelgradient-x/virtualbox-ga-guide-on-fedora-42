Tuning Fedora VM for Optimal Performance in VirtualBox
To make Fedora run properly and performant in VirtualBox, apply the following tuning settings in the VM configuration:

```
Allocate 128 MB of video memory.

Set the graphics controller to VBoxSVGA.

Enable 3D Acceleration for better graphical performance.

Use a Paravirtualized Network adapter for improved network throughput.

Set the storage controller to AHCI Controller.

Bind your Fedora VM's hard disk to the .vdi file.

Bind the VirtualBox Guest Additions ISO to a virtual optical drive.

These settings help improve compatibility, graphics performance, and network speed for Fedora running in VirtualBox.
```
**Important**
The VMSVGA graphics controller is the default Graphic Controller when creating a Fedora VM, it's known to sometimes cause VM freezes and exhibit unusual behavior. To avoid such issues and improve stability, it is recommended to use the VBoxSVGA controller instead. VBoxSVGA generally offers better performance, including 3D acceleration support, and is more reliable for Fedora and other Linux distributions running in VirtualBox (even though it can cause rare visual glitches).
