# -------- Install Guest Additions --------

# 1. Ensure ISO is still mounted, otherwise remount.
cd /run/media/$(whoami)/VBox_GAs_7.2.2

# 2. Uninstall Any Existing Guest Additions Again (in some rare cases, I found Guest Additions still present, and this fixed the issue).
sudo sh ./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run uninstall

# 3. Install Official Guest Additions from ISO.
sudo sh ./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run

# 4. Add User to vboxsf Group (to enable shared folders).
sudo usermod -aG vboxsf $(whoami)

# 5. Final Reboot (to load fresh modules and group settings).
sudo reboot
# sudo reboot -f (if not working).
